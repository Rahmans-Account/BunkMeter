This repo Calculates the total number of classes you nedd to pass the 75% attendance CriteriaðŸ˜Š.

This Repo uses a npm Package Called "date-holidays" to calculate the public holidays in the Semester.

I also added an api call to openai's chatgpt to give a humourous message at the end based on number of classes you need to attend.
